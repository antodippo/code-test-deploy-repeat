						But first things first, let's define these terms: <br/>
						continuous integration is a practice where developers merge their changes back to the master branch 
						as often  as possible, running tests to validate the changes<br/>
					    continuous delivery means that, after CI validation, the deployment process to production is 
						automated and can be triggered simply clicking on a button<br/>
						continuous deployment means that, after CI validation, the deployment to production is triggered

						VONQ is a company that helps other companies to find the right talent for their job vacancies. 
						We have a platform that integrates different services for job marketing, guiding the recruiter with

						I'll tell you how we are trying to build continuous stuff.

					<h3>FEATURE TOGGLES</h3>
					<img src="img/toggle.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						Feature toggles (often called also feature flags) are the technique for adding a functionality in such 
						a way that it can be turned on or off, and it allows developers and product managers to: <br/>
						- integrate code in master branch often, even if a feature is incomplete <br/>
						- change the system behaviour without changing the code <br/>
						- make A/B testing, experimenting feature, doing partial releases, but we'll get to that

					<aside class="notes">
						- release toggles, which allow incomplete features to be integrated into the master branch, and turned on 
						only when completed or when product management decides to: "separating release from deployment". They 
						should have a short life and be changed in a more static way, at the deployment stage <br/>
						- experiment toggles, with which you can place users in specific cohorts and show them a specific version 
						of a feature. They should have a short life and be changed in a dynamic way, probably on each request <br/>
						- ops toggle, to control operational aspects of the system, for example to measure the performance of a 
						specific functionality before rolling it out to all users. They are usually short-lived, but there could 
						also be long-lived ops toggles to switch off heavy and not vital functionalities. They are often managed 
						as a runtime configuration <br/>
						- permission toggles, to release a feature to a set of "premium" users. They are very dynamic, changing 
						for every request, and long-lived <br/>
