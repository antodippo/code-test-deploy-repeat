						But first things first, let's define these terms: <br/>
						continuous integration is a practice where developers merge their changes back to the master branch 
						as often  as possible, running tests to validate the changes<br/>
					    continuous delivery means that, after CI validation, the deployment process to production is 
						automated and can be triggered simply clicking on a button<br/>

						VONQ is a company that helps other companies to find the right talent for their job vacancies. 
						We have a platform that integrates different services for job marketing, guiding the recruiter with 
						recommendations for channels on which advertise it. They are 
						mainly written in PHP and Javascript, but also Python and Scala for the machine learning part. 
						I'll tell you how we are trying to build continuous stuff.

					<h3>FEATURE TOGGLES</h3>
					<img src="img/toggle.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						Feature toggles (often called also feature flags) are the technique for adding a functionality in such 
						a way that it can be turned on or off, and it allows developers and product managers to: <br/>
						- integrate code in master branch often, even if a feature is incomplete <br/>
						- change the system behaviour without changing the code <br/>
						- make A/B testing, experimenting feature, doing partial releases, but we'll get to that

					<aside class="notes">
						- release toggles, which allow incomplete features to be integrated into the master branch, and turned on 
						only when completed or when product management decides to: "separating release from deployment". They 
						should have a short life and be changed in a more static way, at the deployment stage <br/>
						- experiment toggles, with which you can place users in specific cohorts and show them a specific version 
						of a feature. They should have a short life and be changed in a dynamic way, probably on each request <br/>
						- ops toggle, to control operational aspects of the system, for example to measure the performance of a 
						specific functionality before rolling it out to all users. They are usually short-lived, but there could 
						also be long-lived ops toggles to switch off heavy and not vital functionalities. They are often managed 
						as a runtime configuration <br/>
						- permission toggles, to release a feature to a set of "premium" users. They are very dynamic, changing 
						for every request, and long-lived <br/>
