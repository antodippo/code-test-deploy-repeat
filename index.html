						But first things first, let's define these terms: <br/>
						continuous integration is a practice where developers merge their changes back to the master branch 
						as often  as possible, running tests to validate the changes<br/>
					    continuous delivery means that, after CI validation, the deployment process to production is 
						automated and can be triggered simply clicking on a button<br/>
						continuous deployment means that, after CI validation, the deployment to production is triggered

						VONQ is a company that helps other companies to find the right talent for their job vacancies. 
						We have a platform that integrates different services for job marketing, guiding the recruiter from 
						the classification of his vacancy to the recommendations for channels on which advertise it. They are 
						mainly written in PHP and Javascript, but also Python and Scala for the machine learning part. I'll 
						tell you how we are trying to build continuous stuff.

							No matter how big is the feature, just break it in small chunks and when a chunk is ready just 
							make a pull request. The result is small PRs, easily mergeable in the master branch, and easily 
							reviewable. <br/>
							Well, we make a lot of code reviews, it's a significant part of our daily work, but it has a lot 
							of advantages. The most important one is probably the fact that we own the code as a team. We try 
							also to do cross team and cross-language code reviews, that is forcing us to improve the shared 
							knowledge between the teams. We learn and we own the code as a team.<br/>
							And to keep learning, share the knowledge and also to onboard new team members, we try to pair on 
							every feature that we build, and we have specific rules for that, like using Pomodoro technique 
							and switch driver and navigator each pomodoro.

						<h3>FEATURE TOGGLES</h3>
						<img src="img/toggle.png">
						<aside class="notes">
							Feature toggles (often called also feature flags) are the technique for adding a functionality in such 
							a way that it can be turned on or off, and it allows developers and product managers to: <br/>
							change the system behaviour without changing the code <br/>
							integrate code in master branch often, even if a feature is incomplete <br/>
							make A/B testing, experimenting feature, doing partial releases, but we'll get to that

						<pre data-id="code-animation"><code width="300px" class="PHP" data-trim data-line-numbers>
							if ($toggle->isActive()) {
								$this->newFancyFunctionality();
							} else {
								$this->oldFunctionality();
							}
						</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							This is how a feature toggle in code can look like. As you may have understood this is technical 
							debt, there is a price to pay to use this technique, but there are also ways to pay this debt back.
